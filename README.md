# Multimodal-Isolated-Italian-Sign-Language-Recognition
---
---
1st Multimodal Isolated Italian Sign Language Recognition C. using RGB and Radar-RDM Data from the [MultiMeDaLIS Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/iccv-mslr-2025-track-2/data) (Mineo et al., 2024). This track presents a sign language recognition task on our multimodal dataset, featuring RGB videos and 60â€¯GHz radar range-Doppler maps, and including 126 Italian Sign Language gestures (100 medical terms + 26 letters) across 205 expert sessions.
